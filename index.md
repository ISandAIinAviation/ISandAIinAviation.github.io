# **Welcome to the world of Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems**


This is the personal blog of the research group **Cybernetic Intelligent Systems**, a part 
of the [**Business Information Systems**](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/degree-programmes/business/msc-bis) chair at the [**FHNW University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland**](https://www.fhnw.ch/en).

> *Dear visitor,
we are glad to introduce ourselves, our projects, interests and engagements to you. Our team is dedicated and 
> motivated to drive innovation in aviation and related industries through the application of artificial intelligence 
> and development of intelligent systems.*

Our team applies data-driven machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to operations research, focusing on industry needs. The interests and competences of our [team]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/team.md %}) is vast, exemplified by the list of our [current and past projects]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/research.md %}). These projects utilise a broad array of methods, allowing us to exploit methods from the field of classical statistics, causality, reinforcement learning, computer vision and generative modelling. Our latest research projects [AI4REALNET](./pages/projects/ai4realnet.md) and [brAIght](./pages/projects/braight.md) focus heavily on the development of reinforcement learning solutions for process optimisation in aviation, railway and energy systems.

Our fields of expertise range from classic statistical methods to stochastic and machine-based optimization (e.g. Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization), macro- and micro-economic analyses and the modelling and simulation of processes on theground and in the air. In addition to the development of conventional simulation models in the field of discrete-event and agent-based simulation, we also conduct research on new methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence (GANs, Deep Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, etc.). We apply these methods to complex operational problems inside and outside the aviation industry. 

Our main tasks include the simulation of processes such as passenger flow dynamics or baggage fow, capacity analyses and management, delay propagation, revenue management, hub and spoke load balancing and network analyses. The methods and solutions developed provide a basis for decision-making on complex problems as part of operation management for partners within the aviation industry and their stakeholders.
