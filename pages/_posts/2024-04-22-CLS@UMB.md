As part of a video series for internal training and external customer relationship, Manuel Renold gave two talks at [UMB](https://www.umb.ch/) on the latest innovations in the field of AI as well as future trends and potential. He was accompanied by our Unitree RoboDog, as an eye-catcher and representative of embodied AI. His talks in the Volketswil office and in the newly opened office at Puls 5 in Zurich were followed by interesting presentations by [Claudio Mirti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudio-mirti/?originalSubdomain=ch) from Microsoft and their latest AI cloud solutions as well as [Dominic BÃ¶gli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicboegli/?originalSubdomain=ch) from the AI department at UMB. The event concluded with an interesting panel discussion with all the speakers and a networking apero.

Thank you UMB for the invitation and the great event! We are looking forward to future collaborations.
