title: Reinforcement Learning Control Systems for Heat Pumps
description: Research Project in collaboration with Heim AG
---

This innosuisse research project develops a reinforcement learning-based control system to increase the operational efficiency and safety of existin heat pumps. The research team consists of the industry partner [Heim AG](https://www.heim-ag.ch/heizsysteme/), the [Institute of Energy Systems and Fluid Engineering](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/iefe/) (IEFE) from ZHAW, and our team. IEFE is a competence centre in the field of heat pumps and energy systems, and will develop the necessary dynamic simulations with which our team will then trained the developed RL-based control system. 

Heim AG has been successfully manufacturing heat pumps for decades, ranging from small-scale machines to large industrial systems. This project aims to ensure that Heim AG can increase its market share in targeted niche markets with clear unique selling points (USPs). The long-term goal of the project, in addition to creating the USPs through the RL-based control system and the associated dynamic simulations, is to generate valuable insights in the field of predictive maintenance in order to pave the way for strategically important future developments.
