title: Meta-Router 
description: Multimodal and Barrier-Free Routing Solutions
---

The Meta-Router is a new and innovative multimodal routing service for the first and last mile routing problem of the Swiss public transport system. The project is funded by Innosuisse, with a team consisting of [SKI+](https://www.oev-info.ch/de/organisation/ueber-ski), a Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) division, the [Institute of Data Analy-sis and Process Design](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/idp/) from the ZHAW and our group at the FHNW. The goal is to conduct research in the field of multi-agents and hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) and thereby innovate a multimodal and barrier-free routing solution.

The customer is enabled to adapt his travel needs to different means of transportation, which promotes the sustainable shift from motorized individual transport to public transport. Due to the novel solution approach, travel times can be minimized, non-discriminatory access to public transport can be improved and capacity bottlenecks from population growth, can be absorbed.

The new Meta-Router creates social and economic value. It addresses the UN sustainable de-velopment goals (SDGs) 9 to 11 as well as the goal number 13. 

This project is funded by Innosuisse. The project is ongoing and with a start in February 2025
